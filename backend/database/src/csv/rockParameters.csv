The diameter of the platens is slightly greater than the specimen diameter by 0-2 mm. The thickness of the platens is 15 mm or 1/3 of the specimen diameter (whichever is greater).\n The flatness of the surfaces of the disc platens should be better than 0.005 mm. To measure the axial and radial strains use strain gauges or LVDTs with strain sensitivity of 5 x 10-6  For determining the entire stress-strain curve   load the specimen at axial or radial strain rate of 0.001 mm/mm/s (0.1% strain/s) up to 70% of the expected peak stress   then   switch to 0.000001 mm/mm/s (0.0001% strain/s) until the post-failure stress drops to 50% of the peak stress Better not load the specimen using a stress rate because the inevitable result is failure. If the force does not monotonically increase in axial displacement   then   the circumferential displacement can be used as the control variable. As the specimen nears failure   special care must be taken to prevent damage to the deformation-measuring equipment other than strain gauges Determine the Young’s modulus & Poisson’s ratio values   which may vary owing to nonlinearity of the stress vs strain data and choose to report values between 40% and 60% of the peak stress (Fig. 2).

The test measures the wear on the tip of a steel stylus having a Rockwell Hardness of HRC 55±1  A disc-shaped or irregular rock specimen is placed in the test apparatus (West-type or Type 2)   and a stylus is loaded onto the rough or saw-cut surface and pulled under a normal force of 70 N for 10 mm within 10 s. Each rock specimen is tested five times using a new stylus each time.\x The wear surface of each stylus tip is measured under a microscope to an accuracy of 0.01 mm   i.e. typically 120-fold magnification   and the final CAI value is the average of five measurements. Specimens can be tested either dry or wet The CAI is dimensionless and is calculated by multiplying the wear surface stated in units of 0.01 mm by 10. For example   if the wear flat of a stylus tip was measured as being 0.25 mm   the corresponding value of CAI should be reported as 2.5.\x When using a sawn surface or a stylus with hardness other than HRC 55   empirical conversions are applied to adjust the CAI”
