The methylene blue test is performed by taking one drop of suspension by means of a glass rod and depositing it on a filter paper. The stain formed should consist of a solid blue colour surrounded by a colourless wet zone. If a halo does not form, then methylene dye is added in doses of 5 ml. In addition, 30 g of kaolinite can be added to boost the halo appearance\xThe test is considered positive if a halo, consisting of a persistent light blue ring of about 1 mm in the wet zone, is formed. The end point of the test is confirmed by repeating the stain test at 1 min intervals for 5 min, without adding more dye solution\xThe methylene blue test quantifies the reactive, i.e. swelling clay fraction in the fines of an aggregate, by measuring the amount of methylene blue dye that it preferentially adsorbs; the non-swelling clay fraction, which is inert, is virtually non-adsorbent\x The methylene blue value MBV is proportional to the amount of clay minerals in the aggregates.
