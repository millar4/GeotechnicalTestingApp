Bender element tests to determine shear wave (Vs) and compression wave (Vp) velocities in the soil may be part of the triaxial test setup. These velocities are determined from very small‐strain responses measured by bender elements.A shear wave is generated at one end of the soil specimen and then received at the opposite end (Fig. 1). Shear waves generated to determine shear wave velocity can also be polarized in different directions  e.g. vertically or horizontally propagating shear wave with either vertical or horizontal polarization (Fig. 2) \nPrior to testing  the bender elements are checked for polarity and time delay; source and received waves must have the same polarity and the time delay should be measured. Shear wave velocity determination involves very small strains and is non-destructive. Therefore  bender element shear wave velocity determinations can be made at any time and any number of times during a laboratory test\nThe transmitter and receiver are aligned when they share the same plane. Misalignment increases the possibility of contamination with other indirect waves and of receiving weak direct shear waves produced by the transmitter. Top and base caps should have marks that are clear to align the transducers properly\nCoupling between BE and soil is essential to ensure the effective transference of energy between them. The method of introducing the BE into the soil varies depending on its stiffness. The procedure chosen must satisfy: (i) good coupling  (ii) low alteration of the surrounding soil  and (iii) preservation of the integrity of the transducers. For weak soils  protrusion with pressure is acceptable. Excavation of undersized slots and protrusion is used for stiff clays. These slots should be excavated with high precision to have a minimum distance between the elements and the soil. The excavation of oversized slots and sealing is applicable for cemented sands\nThe shear wave travel time is measured over a known travel distance L  i.e. length of specimen  and the shear Vs or or compression wave velocity Vp is calculated by dividing the travel distance L by the travel time t  e.g. peak-to-peak or start-to-start (Fig. 3)\nFrom the wave velocity and the (wet) bulk density of the soil specimen the initial shear modulus (Gmax = ρ x Vs2) or compression modulus (Mmax = ρ x Vp2) are calculated”

Subsequently  cyclic torsional shear is applied to the top of the specimen for a range of excitation levels and torque measurements are directly made at the bottom of the specimen\nThe test is considered non-destructive when the shear strain amplitudes of vibration are less than 0.01%; then  many measurements may be made on the same specimen. Resonant column and torsional shear testing can be followed by an undrained or drained triaxial test\nTest results depend upon the strain amplitude of vibration  the state of effective stress  and the void ratio of the soil  etc.; therefore  their applicability of the test results will depend on the degree to which the test conditions duplicate the field conditions”
